Feature: As a Customer
  In order to know what food to buy (and how much it costs)
  I need to see a menu with a list of dishes (with prices)

  Background:

    Given the following categories exist
      | name    |
      | Starter |
      | Main    |
      | Dessert |

    And the following dishes exist
      | name                  | description          | price | category |
      | Burger Special        | A bacon cheeseburger | 75    | Main     |
      | Not so Special Burger | Meat Burger          | 25    | Main     |


  Scenario: A customer sees a list of dishes divided into categories
    Given I visit the menu page
    Then I should see "Main"

  Scenario: A customer sees a list of dishes on the menu page
    Given I visit the menu page
    Then I should see "Burger Special"
